## How to deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload `index.html` (and this `README.md` if you like) to the root of the repo.
3. Commit the changes.
4. In **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`), folder `/root`
5. Save. GitHub Pages will give you a public URL for the app.
